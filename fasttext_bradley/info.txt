I had a lot of trouble downloading and using the fastText python module for windows. I found a tutorial (https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/issues/548), where u/abulhawa gives instructions on how to run the module on vscode, but I gave up on that route.
tldr: Beware if you don't use unix.

You can install the python module for fasttext with:
	sudo pip install fasttext
You need numpy and scipy as well
